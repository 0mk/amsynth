- now checks for vkeybd on startup and greys out menu item if not found :)

- fixed bug in rc file parsing - failed on lines containing a single '#'
- fixed midi controllers problem - using controllers on alsa midi driver would
freeze the midi thread. stopped use of poll(...), and now seems to work fine.

Well, lots of stuff done today.
- finished updating the ./configure script. no longer uses acinclude.m4
- adapted the whole project to the automake/autoconf system - 'make install' and
'make dist' targets now work fine :)
- rc file and presets now installed on the system
- 'amSynth' is now a script which launches the executable (hidden), so on first
run the default files will be copied, and launches a text editor to make the 
user set it up..
- compile fixes for debuf builds
- wrote performace analyser (sic)
- after analysis, found changing the -mcpu -march flags has no beneficial 
effect, so removed this option. and -O6 is no faster than -O3, so -O3 is now the
default. in fact, ran faster with no -march or -mcpu flags!!
- removed unused files

#	amSynthrc :- 
#		configuration file for amSynth

# set the OSS compatible midi device file to read input data from. 
# eg /dev/midi or /dev/midi00 for some systems.
# ALSA emulated midi devices eg. /dev/snd/midiC0D0 work fine also.

midi_device		/dev/midi

# midi channel to listen for events on. midi channels are numbered 1-16,
# setting midi channel to 0 will listen on all channels

midi_channel	0

# set the OSS digital audio device to output to.

audio_device	/dev/dsp

# sets the sampling rate to use
# lower sampling rates use less CPU power, so more voices are usable at once.
# lower rates do adversely affect the latency, however.
# higher rates obviously result in higher quality sound

sample_rate		44100

# sets the maximum polyphony (simultaneous notes played)
# playing too many motes for your CPU power will do horrible things.
# for reference, my Athlon(classic) 500MHz goes up to 12 (13 if i push it)
# at a sampling rate of 48000.
# dropping the sample rate means you can increase polyphony. so if you drop from,
# say, 44100 to 22050 you can probably double the polyphony.
# default is 10

polyphony		10

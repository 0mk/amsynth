	Well, lots of stuff done today.
	-finished updating the ./configure script. no longer uses acinclude.m4
	-adapted the whole project to the automake/autoconf system - 'make
	install' and 'make dist' targets now work fine :)
	-rc file and presets now installed on the system
	-'amSynth' is now a script which launches the executable (hidden), so
	on first run the default files will be copied, and launches a text
	editor to make the user set it up..
	-compile fixes for debuf builds
	-wrote performace analyser (sic)
	-after analysis, found changing the -mcpu -march flags has no beneficial	effect, so removed this option. and -O6 is no faster than -O3, so -O3 is
	now the default. in fact, ran faster with no -march or -mcpu flags!!
	-removed unused files

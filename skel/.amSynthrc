# select midi driver to use (auto/alsa/oss)
# the ALSA driver uses the sequencer client interface. you will have to 
# 'aconnect' it to something to get input.

midi_driver 	auto

# set the OSS compatible midi device file to read input data from. 
# eg /dev/midi or /dev/midi00 for some systems.
# ALSA emulated midi devices eg. /dev/snd/midiC1D3 work fine also.

oss_midi_device		/dev/midi

# midi channel to listen for events on. midi channels are numbered 1-16,
# setting midi channel to 0 will listen on all channels

midi_channel	0


# select audio driver to use. (auto/alsa-mmap/alsa/oss)
# auto selects the best available driver
# the mmap alsa driver gives the best performance

audio_driver	auto


# set the OSS digital audio device to output to.

oss_audio_device	/dev/dsp


# sets the sampling rate to use
# lower sampling rates use less CPU power, so more voices are usable at once.
# lower rates (below 22050) do adversely affect the latency, however.
# higher rates obviously result in higher quality sound but also lower latency

sample_rate		44100


# sets the maximum polyphony (simultaneous notes played)
# playing too many motes for your CPU power will do horrible things.
# for reference, my Athlon(classic) 500MHz goes up to 12 (13 if i push it)
# at a sampling rate of 48000.
# dropping the sample rate means you can increase polyphony. so if you drop
# from, say, 44100 to 22050 you can probably double the polyphony.
# default is 10

polyphony		10

#
#	MIDI Input Configuration
#

# select midi driver to use [ auto / alsa / oss ]
# the ALSA driver uses the sequencer client interface. you will have to 
# 'aconnect' it to something to get input.

midi_driver 		auto

# set the OSS compatible midi device file to read input data from. 
# eg /dev/midi or /dev/midi00 for some systems.

oss_midi_device		/dev/midi

# midi channel to listen for events on. midi channels are numbered 1-16,
# setting midi channel to 0 will listen on all channels

midi_channel		0


#
#	AUDIO Output Configuration
#

# select audio driver to use. (auto/alsa-mmap/alsa/oss/jack)
# auto selects the best available driver in the order alsa-mmap, alsa, oss
# 'alsa-mmap' has better performance than 'alsa', but may be less compatible
# 'jack' is the best choice for interoperating with other music programs

audio_driver		auto


# set the OSS digital audio device to output to.

oss_audio_device	/dev/dsp

# set the ALSA pcm device to use
# you should probably set this to hw:0 or similar, if you know what youre doing

alsa_audio_device	default

# sets the sampling rate to use
# lower sampling rates use less CPU power, so more voices are usable at once.

sample_rate		44100


#
#	General Options
#

# sets the maximum polyphony (simultaneous notes played)
# playing too many motes for your CPU power will do horrible things.
#
# Pentium3 class machines will safely do 16 voices, (pentium4 2.40GHz = 60)
#
# set this to 0 for unlimited polyphony

polyphony		16

# Specify a specific font to load for the interface

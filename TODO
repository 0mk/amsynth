amSynth TODO list
-----------------

Next revision:
+ stop segfaults when audio subsystem doesn't start up properly
+ decide on & implement meaningful exit codes for script to interpret
+ integrate launch script into auto**** build & install process

Ongoing, ASAP:
+ find & fix audio output bug (output dies & kills output from all programs
  to the soundcard)

Soon, but not urgent:
+ configuration panel for ~/.amSynthrc

long term
+ bandlimited oscillators
+ built-in virtual keyboard
+ add a delay (ie a switchable attack/decay envelope) to lfo

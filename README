Hi, and thanks for your interest in amSynth. ;-)
	http://amsynthe.sourceforge.net
------------------------------------------------

amSynth is a real-time analogue modelling synthesizer.
It currently uses the OSS audio and midi devices for its input and output.

* This isn't an official stable release. *
It is very close to amSynth 1.0 however. 
The features are all here now. New features will be added into amSynthe 
(which will be started in the next month or so), not amSynth.

I hope the amSynth works well for you, and you can get the sounds you want to
create! Good luck!

Running amSynth
---------------
Once youve compiled and put amSynth in your $PATH (you can, of course, also run
it by supplying the full path+executable name) run it with the -h flag to get a
list of command-line options. 

Configuration
-------------
To save passing command-line options every time, you can set the options in the
~/.amSynthrc file. To get an idea what this file looks like, there's an example 
in (this) top-level directory. copy it to your home dir. and edit it to your
taste.

Presets
-------
Presets are stored in the file ~/.amSynth.presets
By default, you will have no presets to play with, you will have to create them
yourself. I have included a ".amSynth.presets" file in this top-level directory,
so you can start playing with some useable sounds straight away. Copy it to your
home dir. 

Known problems
--------------
Although I've been using this software myself for a while without many problems,
I am aware of some issues:-

+ Sometimes the program crashes as soon as you play a note on your MIDI input.
  This only happens on certain GTK themes for some reason(?!?). Themes i have
  had no problems with are "Default", "IceGradient", "ThinIce", "Step"...

+ Under certain conditions (parameter settings) the sound output dies and never
  recovers. This is an issue with the reverb (Freebirth) and the amSynth filter.
  This is being worked on...

+ There is no software limit on the number of simultaneously active voices 
  (polyphony). If you play too many notes at once for your CPU, two things can
  happen:
  + If you aren't running amSynth SUID root (i.e. with realtime priority) you 
    will experience (continuous) buffer dropouts, which will sound like horrible
	distortion.
  + If you are running SUID root, you will also experience dropout, plus your
    system will appear to be locked. This is because amSynth is eating up *all*
	the CPU time, and running at highest priority.
  In both cases, the remedy is to play less notes at once ;-)
  Although you will have to play another note before the others are silenced and
  everything works nicely again. Basically, keep hitting one note on your midi 
  controller keyboard until it returns to normal. Hopefully I will find a good 
  way of enforcing a limit based on the speed of the machine..
  
You have been warned!

Hi, and thanks for your interest in amSynth. ;-)
	http://amsynthe.sourceforge.net
------------------------------------------------

amSynth is a real-time analogue modelling synthesizer.
It currently uses the OSS audio and midi devices for its input and output.

* This isn't an official stable release. *
It is very close to amSynth 1.0 however. 
The basic structure of amSynth is not forseen to change - amSynthe (same 
homepage) has a different goal of a more complex and powerful engine, but it has
not yet been started.

I hope the amSynth works well for you, and you can get the sounds you want to
create! Good luck!

Running amSynth
---------------
Once youve compiled and put amSynth in your $PATH (you can, of course, also run
it by supplying the full path+executable name) run it with the -h flag to get a
list of command-line options. 

Configuration
-------------
To save passing command-line options every time, you can set the options in the
~/.amSynthrc file. To get an idea what this file looks like, there's an example 
in the `skel' directory. copy it to your home dir. and edit it to your
taste.

Presets
-------
Presets are stored in the file ~/.amSynth.presets
By default, you will have no presets to play with, you will have to create them
yourself. I have included a ".amSynth.presets" file in the `skel' directory,
so you can start playing with some useable sounds straight away. Copy it to your
home dir. 

Known problems
--------------
Although I've been using this software myself for a while without many problems,
I am aware of some issues:-

+ Sometimes the program crashes as soon as you play a note on your MIDI input.
  This only happens on certain GTK themes for some reason(?!?). Themes i have
  had no problems with are "Default", "IceGradient", "ThinIce", "Step"...
  (note - this has not been experienced for some time, maybe it's fixed?)

+ Under certain conditions (parameter settings) the sound output dies and never
  recovers. This is an issue with the reverb (Freebirth) and the amSynth filter.
  This is being worked on... (and appears to be fixed)

+ Careful with the polyphony! If you play too many notes at once for your CPU, 
  two things can happen:
  + If you aren't running amSynth SUID root (i.e. with realtime priority) you 
    will experience (continuous) buffer dropouts, which will sound like horrible
	distortion.
  + If you are running SUID root, you will also experience dropout, plus your
    system will appear to be locked. This is because amSynth is eating up *all*
	the CPU time, and running at highest priority.
  Experiment with the "polyphony" setting in .amSynthrc or with the `-p' option
  on the command line.

  For reference, my Athlon (classic) 500MHz can play 13 notes @ 48000KHz.
  A test on a k62-500 though, gave only 5 notes @ 44100.. :( probably to do with
  the size of the CPU cache..
  If you want more polyphony, drop the sample rate. halving the sample rate gives
  roughly twice the polyphony...
  
You have been warned!

But more importantly, have fun ;-)

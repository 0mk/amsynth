amsynth -- http://code.google.com/p/amsynth/
--------------------------------------------

amsynth is an analog modelling (a.k.a virtual analog) synthesizer.

It mimics the operation of early analog subtractive synthesizers with
classic oscillator waveforms, envelopes, filter, modulation and effects.

The aim was to keep the synth easy to use, so you can more easily get the
sounds you want ;-)


There are currently several different ways to run amsynth:
* stand-alone application using JACK, ALSA or OSS
* DSSI plug-in
* LV2 plug-in
* VST plug-in



VST PLUGIN BUILD
----------------

* Download Steinberg's VST SDK and extract files from archive
* run ./configure VST_SDK=/path/to/vstsdk2.4
* make && make install
-> amsynth_vst.so will be installed to $(prefix)/lib/vst


PRESET BANK MANAGEMENT         (New in version 1.4)
----------------------

The default user bank is located at ~/.amSynth.presets

amsynth now allows you to quickly access other preset banks that are stored in
the following directories:

  ~/.amsynth/banks
  /usr/share/amsynth/banks      (read-only access)

Any valid preset banks that are found in these directories will be show in the
drop-down bank selector on the GUI (standalone version only.)



BUGS

If you encounter any problems with amsynth, please report them!

NOTE TO PACKAGERS
-----------------

The standalone and plugin GUIs all depend on common data installed to
$(pkgdatadir) (e.g. /usr/share/amsynth) so you may want to create an
amsynth-data package and have several binary packages which depend on
this (e.g. amsynth-dssi amsynth-lv2 and amsynth-standalone)

amsynth -- http://code.google.com/p/amsynth/
--------------------------------------------

amsynth is an analog modelling (a.k.a virtual analog) synthesizer.

It mimics the operation of early analog subtractive synthesizers with
classic oscillator waveforms, envelopes, filter, modulation and effects.

The aim was to keep the synth easy to use, so you can more easily get the
sounds you want ;-)


There are currently several different ways to run amsynth:
* stand-alone application using JACK, ALSA or OSS
* DSSI plug-in
* LV2 plug-in

	Hi, and thanks for your interest in amSynth. ;-)

	------------------------------------------------

amSynth is a real-time analogue modelling synthesizer.
It currently uses the OSS/ALSA audio and midi devices for its input and output.

	** Welcome to the rc2 "jack" release of amSynth **

The basic structure of amSynth is not forseen to change - amSynthe (same 
homepage) has a different goal of a more complex and powerful engine, but it has
not yet been started. Work is now underway on turning amSynth into a plugin 
shared library, which will make it easy to integrate with many software 
packages.

I hope that amSynth works well for you, and you can get the sounds you want to
create! Good luck!

Running amSynth
---------------
read INSTALL for installation instructions!!

Once youve compiled and put amSynth in your $PATH (you can, of course, also run
it by supplying the full path+executable name) run it with the -h flag to get a
list of command-line options. 

Configuration
-------------
To save passing command-line options every time, you can set the options in the
~/.amSynthrc file. Also, there are some options which can only be set in this 
file, so it is recommended to create one.
To get an idea what this file looks like, there's an example in the `skel' 
directory. copy it to your home dir. and edit it to your taste.

Presets
-------
Presets are stored in the file ~/.amSynth.presets
By default, you will have no presets to play with, you will have to create them
yourself. I have included a ".amSynth.presets" file in the `skel' directory,
so you can start playing with some useable sounds straight away. Copy it to your
home dir. 

Known problems
--------------
Although I've been using this software myself for a while without many problems,
I am aware of some issues which have arisen in the past :-

+ Careful with the polyphony! If you play too many notes at once for your CPU, 
  two things can happen:
  + If you aren't running amSynth SUID root (i.e. with realtime priority) you 
    will experience (continuous) buffer dropouts, which will sound like horrible
	distortion.
  + If you are running SUID root, you will also experience dropout, plus your
    system will appear to be locked. This is because amSynth is eating up *all*
	the CPU time, and running at highest priority.
  Experiment with the "polyphony" setting in .amSynthrc or with the `-p' option
  on the command line.
  
You have been warned!

But more importantly, have fun ;-)

	!! IMPORTANT !!

If you find a bug in amSynth, or just something plain annoying, please give some
feedback, this is the only way the software will improve, and you want that, 
don't you? ;-)
